Data and code corresponding to the study on GP surgeries in the UK/England.

# How to use the files and associated code
These datasets have been uploaded to allow replication of the results presented. To do so, the first step is to download the datasets on your local machine, then convert the ".xlsb" binary formats into ".xlsx" or ".csv" formats (the RStudio code provided will have specific format requirements). Then, launch RStudio, copy/paste the code given, and run the code. You will need to adapt the folder directory paths specified in the code to your local folder pathways.
